# Reindeer use cases
An increasing number of public RNA-seq datasets are now available with more than  500,000 RNA-seq libraries listed on the SRA repository, over 7000 species. This huge body of publicly available RNA-Â­seq libraries is a treasure of functional information.
The objective of the Transipedia project is to provide the scientific community with a new way to obtain insights from OMICS data that may deliver results not obtainable through traditional means. Organizing large scale data collection is performed towards REINDEER, that builds a data-structure that indexes k-mers and their abundances from a collection of raw RNA-seq. The TranSipedia web site then provides a high flexibility for producing smart information  from big data.  
With **Reindeer-uses-cases**, we propose to highlight TranSipedia flexibility and computational efficiency that make it attractive as a new transcriptional profiling approach for a wide variety of applications.

## Sequence search at Transipedia web site:

1. Select one or several indexes.
2. Select the sequence mode: 
	* sequences can be submitted as input by cut-paste step in a fasta format. The sequences could be kmers of at least 31nt length or longer sequences (see test sequences with Try it), 
	* The user can up-loaded a list of sequences of interest in a fasta file. At most XXX sequences can be submitted at a time. For bigger datasets, the user needs to  interrogate the index by command lines (see [Reindeer](https://github.com/kamimrcht/REINDEER/blob/master/README.md)).
3. Select the counting method: `raw` or `normalized` counts (kmer count/total kmers).
4. Submit the request.
5. Select the metadata button `More details` when available.


## USE_CASE 1

The use-case 1 is a **mutation sequence search**

1. Open the [Transipedia web site](https://transipedia.org).
2. Select CCLE RNAseq (1019 trimmed experiment)
3. Select the fasta file [BRAF_V600.fa](https://github.com/Transipedia/Reindeer-use-cases/blob/main/BRAF_V600.fa).
